# 🌍 KEN-ORM - PHP Framework

Welcome to **KEN-ORM**, a minimalistic PHP framework I'm building as a learning tool.  
The goal is to explore and understand core PHP concepts such as:

- 🧑‍💻 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- 🛠️ **PHP Data Objects (PDO)** for database interactions
- 🚀 **Migrations** and database management
- Plus, other important fundamentals.

> **Note:** This framework is **not** designed for production use.  
> It's purely educational and inspired by the elegant architecture of **Laravel**.
